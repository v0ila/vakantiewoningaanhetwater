Setup
Add your email account details into assets/php/send.php to send emails.
.htaccess has a rewrite condition that removes the .php extension (important hidden file).

Images
In assets/img there is 3 folders each containing a main.jpg which is used for the header of the page. The rest are automatically picked up and used for the galleries on each page so just drop images into the folders to create a nice gallery.
The main images are all cached on loading the index page via css (#one-cache, #two-cache, #three-cache).

Resources
Bulma
Simplelightbox
PHPMailer
A keyboard


Have a nice day!
